Short routine to adjust noise sensitivity on a GT911 chip
as used by the Guition ESP32-S3 480x480 4 inch display.

Use with EXTREME caution. This code has the ability to brick
your screen if used incorrectly.

If you use this code, and your display breaks, you get to keep
all the pieces. I will not accept responsibility or liability
for breakages.
